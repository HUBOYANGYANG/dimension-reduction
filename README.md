Description: The curse of dimensionality is a common challenge in machine learning, where datasets often comprise thousands to millions of features per training instance. This not only slows down the training process but also makes finding good solutions more difficult. To address this issue, dimensionality reduction methods such as PCA, LDA, t-SNE, and LLE are commonly used. In this project, we will implement these four dimensionality reduction methods using Rcpp and compare their performance with the built-in functions in R. By evaluating their efficiency and accuracy, we aim to assess the effectiveness of the Rcpp implementations and determine which method performs best in terms of reducing dimensionality while preserving information.
